# Tonic Trouble Special Edition Savegame Encryption & Decryption Algorithm

I created this project primarily to practice reversing. I don't know if there's already some library out there that can encrypt or decrypt the savegames & config files of *Tonic Trouble*. I tested this code on all the different savegame files and config files the game creates. I don't think this is used on other files. You can decrypt a file, make modifications to it, encrypt it again, and the game reads it just fine.

The algorithm used here seems to be a custom stream cipher. Here's a little breakdown.

## Encryption Process

### Step 1
- A 2048 byte key stream is created, structured in 8 byte chunks. The key stream starts from `0000 0000` and goes up to `FFFF FFFF`.
- Two rolling keys are initialized:
  - **Rolling Key 1** initialized with the value `87`.
  - **Rolling Key 2** initialized with the value `0`.

- The output file is initially written with 5 dummy bytes, which will be overwritten later.
- These dummy bytes are written by XORing the following:
  - **First Byte**: A key XORed by `0x53`.
  - **Next 4 Bytes**: Another key XORed by `0x54555657`.
- The key used at this point is just `0`, so essentially the XOR constants are stored in the file.

### Step 2
- Chunks of 8 bytes are read from the input file and saved into a temporary buffer.
- Keep track of total bytes read (stored in `Total Bytes Read`).
- These chunks are matched with parts of the key stream:
  - The key stream is looped through in 8 byte chunks.
  - The number of matching characters between the buffer and each 8 byte chunk of the key stream is counted.
  - The offset in the key stream where the best match is found is stored for use in the next steps.

- The bits of **Rolling Key 1** are reversed, and the following operation is performed:

  ```
  offset ^ reversed_key ^ 0xB9
  ```

- The result is written into the output file.
  - `Rolling Key 1` is incremented by `1`.
  - `Rolling Key 2` is incremented by the value of the match offset.

### Step 3
- A bitmask is created to find mismatches between the buffer and the corresponding chunk in the key stream.
- The comparison is made at an offset of `8 * match_offset` in the key stream.
- For every mismatch found, the corresponding bit in the mask is set to `1`.
- This mask is then XORed with the reversed **Rolling Key 1** and the constant `0xB9`:

  ```
  mask ^ reversed_key ^ 0xB9
  ```

- The result is written into the output file.
  - `Rolling Key 1` is incremented by `1`.
  - `Rolling Key 2` is incremented by the value of the mask.

### Step 4
- Loop through the 8 byte temporary buffer.
- For each bit in the bitmask that is set to `1` (indicating a mismatch):
  - The corresponding character in the buffer is XORed with `Rolling Key 1` and `0xB9`, and written into the output file.
  - Both rolling keys are incremented with each write:
    - `Rolling Key 1` by `1`.
    - `Rolling Key 2` by the value of the character in the buffer.

### Repeat
Steps 2â€“4 loop until the entire file is read.

### Final Step
- The first 5 dummy bytes are overwritten in the output file:
  - First byte: `Rolling Key 2` XORed with `0x53`
  - Next 4 bytes: `Total Bytes Read` XORed with `0x54555657`

## Decryption Process

### Step 1
- A 2048 byte key stream is created, structured in 8 byte chunks from `0000 0000` to `FFFF FFFF`.
- Two rolling keys are initialized:
  - **Rolling Key 1** with `87`.
  - **Rolling Key 2** with the first byte from the input file.
- Skip 4 bytes at file offset `1` to `4`.

### Step 2
- Two bytes are read from the input file: `read byte 1` and `read byte 2`.
- When `read byte 1` is read, the bits of **Rolling Key 1** are reversed and used in:

  ```
  read_byte ^ reversed_key ^ 0xB9
  ```

- After each byte:
  - `Rolling Key 1` is incremented by `1`.
  - `Rolling Key 2` is decremented by the value of the read byte.

### Step 3
- Check if the least significant bit of `read byte 2` is `1`.
- If so, store the result from the previous step into the key stream at offset `read byte 1 * 8`.
- Either way, copy the current processed byte from the key stream into a temporary buffer.
- Shift bits of `read byte 2` right by `1`.
- Write the buffer into the output file.

### Repeat
Until the end of the file.
